I didn't play this until summer 2020, at the end of the 8th generation. I fell in love with the story and characters. Joel and Ellie's relationship was so powerful and without giving anything away was one of the best relationships in any game ever.

The characters are all so unique and lovable, you grow attached to them. The game is a great balance between love, violence, revenge, grief, anger and sacrifices. The zombies are also extremely unique with varieties and unique abilities.
