                        Sony Interactive Entertainment, Insomniac Games, and Marvel have teamed up to create a brand-new and

                        This is an experienced Peter Parker who’s more masterful at fighting big crime in New York City. 
                        At the same time, he’s struggling to balance his chaotic personal life and career while the fate of millions 
                        of New Yorkers rest upon his shoulders.

                                        Marvel's Spider-Man is one of the best games I have ever played, there are so many things that 
                                        I enjoyed here that I wish I could play it all over again. It is a beautiful tribute to one of my 
                                        favorite characters of all time. The way Insomniac crafted this game shows how passionate and dedicated 
                                        the studio was to these characters and universe.

                                        Having never played a Spider-man game before this, I was fortunate to not be going in with 
                                        anything to compare the game to or anything to really hold the story up to, apart from the 
                                        films from the early 2000s onwards. Despite this, I can truly say that this game is not only 
                                        the best Spider-man game ever created, it is the best superhero game ever created.

                                        I am not exaggerating at all when I say this, THIS IS THE BEST MARVEL GAME IN EXISTENCE! Though the game takes some stuff from the arkham series it is still original in many ways. 
                                        Spectacular! It truly makes you feel like your right there as spider-man, webbing criminals to the wall, kicking them off buildings.
