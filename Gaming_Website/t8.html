                                        Been a tekken fan since the first one. 
Graphics have been bumped up immensely compared to 7. The visual effects for me are better than mk1 or street fighter 6. 
The combat system has been changed significantly with the new heat meter. Able to extend combos or deal more damage when catching opponents with counters.

                                        This is the TEKKEN game I’ve been waiting for, for the last 18 years. Finally we got a beautiful TEKKEN story that makes sense, and that I wish was a bit longer. The father son fight I’ve always wanted. The call backs to previous games in the franchise that add a huge amount of nostalgia. Super smooth fight mechanics and jaw dropping graphics.
Great character development and a huge focus on my all time favourite character, Jin Kazama. TEKKEN 8 gets a 5/5 from me.

                                        This game has an amazing story mode that blows mk1 story mode out of the water. Jin kazama character development is amazing and definitely one of the best character development in gaming history.

The characters are amazing as usual and the high detail quality graphics are incredible and near perfection. 

Tekken 8 is a great game and a must play. 5/5
