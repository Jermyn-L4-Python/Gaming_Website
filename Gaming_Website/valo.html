                <h3> CHALLENGE THE IMPOSSIBLE </h3><br>
                    <p>VALORANT is a global arena in which you can compete. It is a 5v5 tactical shooter in which players 
                        can take turns planting and defusing spikes with a one-life-per-round system during a series of 13 rounds. 
                        What you'll need more than guns and bullets is to choose an operator equipped with fast, lethal, and 
                        adaptable abilities to create the right opportunities for you to impress everyone with your superior 
                        weapon skills.

                                    Highly rate this game as an experienced CSGO streamer for 8 years. 
                                    Valorant brings very crafted gameplay with a close similar shooting mechanic to 
                                    CSGO whilst adding more technical ability which I consider to be an advanced version of 
                                    utility in the round.

                                Valorant struck a balance between being easy to pick up yet hard to master. This approach has become a template for many future FPS titles.
                                Incorporating character-specific abilities added a layer of strategy uncommon to the genre, sparking a trend in FPS design.
